I picked Advanced manufacturing science as my major because it seemed like a stable field that allowed me freedom of choice in how I applied my learned skills. I could manufacture parts that go to space, build foundational knowledge that could be used in a start-up, or even just see where the winds of life take me. The possibilities seemed endless, and that made me happy, so I rolled with it. Even if I don't know anything right now, I trust my brain and enjoy a good challenge.
